# Getting Started with Lendis Tech Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Docker

For docker only use: `docker-compose up` and then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## As a HTML, JS, CSS project
Just open the `index.html` file inside the `/build` folder. Surely it should be on a server.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
